## Description of Game
### 'This Magic Eight Ball'
This Magic Eight Ball is based off of the eight ball game where the player shakes the plastic Eight Ball Toy and the the die inside answers the player's question.
In 'This Magic Eight Ball' your luck is tracked with a number at the end of the game.
 This Magic Eight Ball contains a 20-sided die with 8 positive answers, 
8 negative answers, and 8 neutral responses such as 
“Concentrate and ask again” and “Reply hazy, try again.” 


## How to play
### "This Magic Eight Ball'
When playing the the 4d Eight Ball game the answers on the white die are raised to the screen so that they can be visible that they are visisble to the player. If an answer is not appreciated, players may decide to shake the ball again with the same question, or ask another question, or stop.
 In this electronic version you ask you question in the box provided, hit 'proceed' and one of the 20 answers is generated.  The first 8 positive answers equals +1, of the the 8 negative answers a point is subtracted (equal -1) and the remaining 4 neutral answers are 'null'.  
Players are able to ask 'This Magic Eight Ball' to eight questions.  Once the eight questions have been asked the final score is revealed.  And the final status of the game is that you are 'having a great day' (2-8), 'having a pleasant day' -2 -2, or having a 'no worries, try again later' day.
No final score is kept. . .just a fun game to add tempo to you day.
